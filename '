### Introduction

I have been interested in Murakami for awhile now, and this was just my second
read. I have watched several videos where translators got together and talked
about the genius within him. I guess I was intrigued to pick this after
watching that video. I had read *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running* a
year back and I liked his style of writing - simple and elegant. Also Norwegian
Wood was one of his famous works that gave him his greatest audience after his
previous works. So I felt that I had to check it out, given that it was also a
weird romance novel.

### 2/11/22 - The day of completion.

This was more of a tradegy than a love story. Well, all love stories are
somewhat of a tradegy. 


I knew I was in the final few pages of the book and so I
did put in a great deal of effort to finish it today. I read on the train, on the way
to work, read in the toilet, read at lunchtime, read all the way back home, sat
at the LRT platform to finish reading the book before returning back home. And
I did complete it. 


It is weird or rather shameful to say that I did forget about a few
scenes from the beginning of the book. I am not sure if it is because scenes
were actually forgettable or because I just took a really long time to
complete this. I feel it might have been a few months? I don't recall when
I started with the novel. 


I can't really come to conclusions about the book. And I don't really
understand why I am having difficulty coming up with some sort of a structured
response for this. Maybe it is because I have to give some time before I can
form an opnion. But this book was intense for sure. Back-to-back suicides are
not something that is very digestable. However, I felt the sadness Toru felt is
something any of us can understand and take in. There were a lot of beautiful
moments in the book, where Murakami was trying to let us
hang in suspension. In some sort of frozen state. And I loved that. I loved
the sadness, I loved the sexuality of the characters, I loved that mundane of
everyday activities that Toru had to endure. I loved the slowness of
the world. I loved to be frozen in time between the pages, with the
characters. Ah, this was a beautiful book indeed.


I don't think many would love it, mainly because there is no story per se. It
was more off a zoom-in and zoom-out sort of story where I suddenly jump into
someone's life for a prolonged period of time and then jump out. I just
followed along till the author decided that I should get out, and that's what
happened. It gave a lot of Manchester By the Sea vibes - a movie of similar
taste, vibe and slowness. 


I think I loved the weirdness of it. The things a particular character did,
wow, it was just so horrifyingly weird I loved it so much. It was such a
doubtful thing that the Toru did not go "wtf" throughout the book.
But it sort of goes to show the depth in characters Murakami envisioned. People
in real life are definitely much weirder, so this to me was a reflection of
that - or at least a subset of that.

I need to ponder about this more.

### 5/11/22 - A few days later.


Okay, It has been a few days, and I have let the feeling percolate a little. I think
the story was mostly a little window to understand depression a little better.
I think there were multiple people who had it and just took their lives away -
but they spoke and behaved like normal people. On hindsight, I should have slowed
down during the conversations to understand the depth of the depressed characters better.
I guess that's why the deaths were surprising. However, I feel it was also the
overcoming of the darkness. I am pretty sure Toru was depressed as well, but there was a
fight in him. A fight to not take the easy way out, a fight to continue staying
in this world. Nearing the end of the book, he was in his worst shape. He let his
body and mind wander, but he stayed on. I think that was personally inspiring. People who
fight on to stay alive are always inspiring. 


I think I liked Naoko the most. I believe it was because she was the most
broken. Broken beyond repair. There was beauty in her fight I believe. She had
difficulty writing letters to Toru and I believe that was the worsening of her
condition. I wonder if fighting inner demons would impair someone to write.


Oh, and I think it is easy to forget that this story was set in the 1960s and
1970s. So people HAD to write to each other, since making calls over the phone
was not that common. I think there was this month where Toru would just keep
writing and writing to many people. That sounded beautiful to me. Putting in
effort to write physical letters and then posting them out. Something so
soothing and satisfying of a slow-paced world. 


Something about Midori was a little off though. It is difficult for me to put
into words but it seemed that the character was forced. Forced into
imagination. Either I have not come across someone whose attributes are alike
hers or Murakami just forced this character out of him. But the character was
indeed a breath of fresh air for Toru. Someone like that would light up
anyone's day. She certainly did mine - I would love it if someone just comes
over while I'm having a coffee to talk to me or pull me to go for a walk
somewhere.


I think Murakami's descriptions of places were really easy to take in. Some authors have
this habit of painting descriptions for the sake of painting it. But Murakami
held back on this front - which I loved. He only sprinkled what was necessary
and those bits stayed with me till the very end.


The ending was a little weird. A whole lot weirder than I anticipated. But I
understood the reasoning and it felt natural for the events to take place that
way. There was a little surrealism I believe - but I don't think I caught it
that well. After the ending, the prologue seemed to have a much greater weight.
The book begins with him reminscing about the past, some 20 years later. And
that's when it hit me - the dead remain dead while the living contain them
within themselves and give them life.


I read this for three or four months but I really enjoyed the slow read.
The slowness of pain, death, love and the overcoming of it all.
